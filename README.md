A blank canvas starting plate for an Alt:V server, using mysql, tailwind, typescript and Vue.

I can't take crredit for this as most the work was already done by Stuyk, with a final finishing touch by coDex to plug it all together.
Just putting it on here, for anyone that wants to use altV, typescript and Vue without the need to figure out how to piece it all together.

Added a Vue install and connected it to the webviews, to save you the hard work...
Credit to: coDex#3718 over on Discord, for his declaration module for the final working piece.

Installation:
If you clone the repo, then run npm install, It should install all the required modules.
You will need to then change to the webviews folder, and again run npm install.

Shouldn't have any problems from then on out.
