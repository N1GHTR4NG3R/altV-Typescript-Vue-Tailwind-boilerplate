## Altv, Typescript, Tailwind and Vue Boilerplate

A blank canvas starting plate for an Alt:V server, using mysql, tailwind, typescript and Vue.

I can't take credit for this as most the work was already done by Stuyk, with a final finishing touch by coDex to plug it all together.
Just putting it on here, for anyone that wants to use altV, typescript and Vue without the need to figure out how to piece it all together.

## Stuyks Original Baseplate:

[altv-typescript](https://github.com/Stuyk/altv-typescript)

Added a Vue install and connected the webviews, to save you the hard work...

Credit to: coDex#3718 over on Discord, for his declaration module for the final working piece, to get Vue to work.

## Installation:

1: Clone this repo

2: Visit the [AltV Server Setup](https://docs.altv.mp/js/articles/setup.html) and download the server files, Including the Data Files and JS Module, the rest is optional.

3: Extract the downloaded files into the file directory of the cloned repo.

4: Run `npm install`, in the root file directory.

5: Change your directory to webviews, and run `npm install` again.

You should then be able to change back to the previous directory in the terminal and run `npm run windows` (Or linux)... and `npm run serve`

Connect to the server through the altV client, and if the altV logo image is showing in the bottom right, with your character, everything has been successful.

Shouldn't have any problems from then on out.
